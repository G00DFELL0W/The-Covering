the network  # The-Covering
 this project is aimed at developing a personalized browser for navigating decentalized networks 
 the applicatiion will serve as the operators identity, wallet, and browser.
 the operation of the application will need to be authorized by an endorser.
 in areas such as "athletics" the endorser would be the operator's (athelete's) coach. 
 the endorser would grant access to the app due to eligebility garanted at the result of the athelete completion of a negative drug test.
 the athelete (operator) would then upload a profile image and develop their identity which could be canceled at any time by only the operator. The operator would lose their eligibility upon failure of a drug test, violation of the code of conduct. 
 the endorser (coach) would update the stats of any atheletes on their team who had passed a drug test.
 this would allow any player on the network to view other athletes whom they are in competition with.
 teams would also be able to view the stats of rivals they intend to play in the future.
 the functionality of the wallet would be limited to eligible players through the distribution of their endorser acting as a masternode.
 colleges and scouts would also be able to view player stats while operating as endorsers or through the purchase of tokens.
 every week the top performing team would be awarded (amount to be determined) in cryptocurrency of tokens, this donation would go to the team to compensate for equipment, transportation, coach's salary, and offset the cost of any expenses that the players may be required to pay out of pocket.
the amount to money earned by each player for their team will be visible along with their stats and eligebility. This creates competition to raise funds for the team and ranks the top "paid" as well as top performing users.
the operators identity will act a browser to navigate the network. 
only a user/operator will have access to their identity, along with masternodes/endorsers capability to update player stats and issue tokens for eligibility/functionality.
users who maintain eligibility between updates would be compensated in tokens/functionality.
when a users profile/stats are viewed by another player a portion of the token used for funtionality would go to the player or team who's stats were viewed.
