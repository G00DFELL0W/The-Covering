the network  # The-Covering
 this project is aimed at developing a personalized browser for navigating and expanding decentalized networks 
 the applicatiion will serve as the operators identity, wallet, and browser.
 the operation of the application will need to be authorized by an endorser.
 in areas such as "athletics" the endorser would be the operator's (athelete's) coach. 
 the endorser would grant access to the application due to eligebility granted as the result of the athelete completion of a negative drug test.
 the athelete (operator) would then upload a profile image and develop their identity which could be canceled at any time by only the operator. The operator would lose their eligibility upon failure of a drug test or violation of the code of conduct. 
 the endorser (coach) would update the stats of any atheletes on their team who had passed a drug test.
 this would allow any player on the network to view other athletes whom they are in competition with.
 teams would also be able to view the stats of rivals they intend to play in the future.
 the functionality of the wallet would be limited to eligible players. Eligibility would be overseen by their endorser acting as a "masternode" and distributing "tokens of eligibility" to their wallets that will enable functionality.
 eligibility will be availible to all students and distributed through the endorser's or "masternode"
 through the browser functionality students grades and accomplishments such as volunteer efforts and awards will be updated just as an athelete would have their stats updated.
 the browser functionality serves to create a network that can be viewed by students, their parents, viewed by colleges and potential employers, as well as updated by their teachers and coaches.
"masternodes" will award functionality to students in the(amount to be determined) while updating the profile stats and grades ect.
functionality will be staked by the "masternodes" and given to the masternodes to be distributed. Any school acting as a "masternode" causes sustainability within the network and put the distribution in the hands of those who bennefit from the program. 
funcionality tokens serve as currency for updating the network as well as using the system. The schools are essentially given tokens in order to update the system. the "masternodes" stake, causes them to be awarded new tokens every distribution cycle. the tokens would be awarded as functionality to the students as the administrators "pay" to update the students stats and grades ect.
third parties would be able to access the network through an application with wallet features in order to purchase functionality. this puts a wallet in the hands of interested parties (parents, colleges, employers) and allows funtionality to view student grades, stats, and achievements.
the cost of functionality tokens distributed outside of the network is to generate a method to compensate schools for equipment, transportation, coach's salary, and offset the cost of any expenses that the players may be required to pay out of pocket. 
only a user/operator will have access to their identity, along with masternodes/endorsers capability to update student stats and issue tokens for eligibility/functionality.
users who maintain eligibility between updates would be compensated in tokens/functionality at the point of the stat update.
when a users profile/stats are viewed by another student a portion of the token used would go to the student who's stats were viewed.

this platform is to be supported on a community
